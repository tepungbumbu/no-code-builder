# Quick Start Guide ⚡️

This guide will get you up and running with the **No-Code Website Builder** in less than 2 minutes!

## 🧪 The "Lazy" Way (Auto-Login)

We have set up a **Demo Account** for you so you don't have to register.

1.  **Start the app** (if haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  **Open your browser** to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3.  **That's it!** The app will automatically log you in as `demo@example.com` and take you to the dashboard.

## 🎮 How to Play Around

Once you are in, here is what you can do:

### 1. Open a Project
You will see a project called **"My First Website"**. Click the **"Edit"** button (pencil icon) to open it.

### 2. The Editor Screen
This is where the magic happens.
- **Left Side**: Your toolbox. Drag things like Buttons, Text, or Images from here into the center.
- **Center**: The Canvas. This is your website page. Drop items here!
- **Right Side**: The Settings. Click on any item in the canvas to change its color, text, or size here.

### 3. Make Changes
- Try dragging a **Button** onto the page.
- Click the button, then change its text in the Right Panel.
- Try changing the view to **Mobile** (click the phone icon at the top) to see how it looks.

## 🔑 Login Details (If needed)

If you ever get logged out, use these:
- **Email**: `demo@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to save my work?**
A: No! The app auto-saves everything you do.

**Q: Can I create a new project?**
A: Yes! Go back to the Dashboard and click "Create New Project".

**Q: Is this a real website on the internet?**
A: Not yet. Right now it's running locally on your computer. To put it on the internet, you would need to "Deploy" it (which is a more advanced topic).

**Q: I broke something! How do I reset?**
A: Since this is a demo running in memory, just restart the terminal command (`npm run dev`), and it might reset some data depending on how it's saved. Or just delete the project and make a new one!

Enjoy building! 🎨✨
